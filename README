This is a collection of stuff to help building iOS app with Gauche.
We're still in experimental stage.  Many desired features are missing.


Building frameworks:

  Prerequisites: You need Gauche HEAD installed on your Mac.

  Gauche-iOS-core.framework

    A Gauche engine packaged as a framework.

    You can build it by running "make core" in this directory.
    It will clone Gauche repo and build the framework.

    To use it, add this to "Linked Frameworks and Libraries"
    section of General tab in your XCode project.
    You also need to add libiconv.dylib and libz.dylib.

    This only allows iOS app to call Gauche core functionalities; it
    doesn't provide a way to control iOS components from Gauche.
    We're working on another framework that allows it.


Samples:

  samples/Gauche-workbench

    This builds a bare bone iOS App with Gauche REPL server open to
    the network.  No UI.  You can evaluate Gauche expressions 
    interactively on the actual device.
    There's no security, so this is stricly for testing in your local
    environment.  Do not run this while you're outside of your lab.
    You need WiFi connection.

    When invoked, it displays "connect X.X.X.X:YY for REPL".  You
    can make a TCP connection to the displayed IP addr and port number,
    e.g. using "telnet X.X.X.X YY".
