This is a collection of stuff to help building iOS app with Gauche.
We're still in experimental stage.  Many desired features are missing.

Contents:

Gauche-iOS-core.framework/

   A prebuilt framework, provided for the convenience.
   To use it, add this to "Linked Frameworks and Libraries"
   section of General tab in your XCode project.
   You also need to add libiconv.dylib and libz.dylib.

   This is occasionally updated, but if you need to rebuild
   to catch up for Gauche HEAD, run "make core" in this directory,
   which will clone Gauche repo and build the framework.
   *You need Gauche HEAD installed on your Mac to rebuild the framework.*

samples/

   Some XCode projects to serve as samples.

samples/Gauche-workbench

   This builds a bare bone iOS App with Gauche REPL server open to
   the network.  No UI.  You can evaluate Gauche expressions 
   interactively on the actual device.
   There's no security, so this is stricly for testing in your local
   environment.
   You need WiFi connection.

   When invoked, it displays "connect X.X.X.X:YY for REPL".  You
   can make a TCP connection to the displayed IP addr and port number,
   e.g. using "telnet X.X.X.X YY".
